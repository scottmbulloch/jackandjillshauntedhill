Hopefully you'll be lucky enough...to make it out...ALIVE!!!</p>

				<h3>Those that made it out have said:</h3>
				<blockquote>Hands down the creepiest and most intimate spookfest I've ever seen. I would give it two thumbs up, and my girlfriend would tell you to wear diapers!</blockquote>
				<blockquote>I have been to a few of the big haunted houses this year and wasnt happy for the price they charge. by far this was the best one i have ever been to and it was cheap. already cant wait for next year! wow freaked me out. couldnt sleep!!!!</blockquote>
				<blockquote>This Haunted House was definitely worth it. Its better than the expensive ones. They get all up in your face!</blockquote>
				<blockquote>REALLY REALLY WELL DONE !!! My wife, daughter and I were impressed. Worth every penny and then some.</blockquote>
				<blockquote>My husband and I went last year and thought that (for the price) it may not be that great. We were WRONG! They put on a great show and I was literally screaming - or swearing - the entire time. It's just long enough for you to have fun, get scared but not so long that you really start to want out. Another cool part, real actors.</blockquote>
				<blockquote>I have been to many haunted houses, but not like this one. It did not last long, but it is well worth the price.</blockquote>
				<blockquote>What an AWESOME haunted house! The best I've been too in a long time - very original, loved the Jack &amp; Jill theme. The actors were great and I loved the setting - going into rooms and having doors closed on us!!! Wow, we were scared too death! High Five for emotionally traumatized! Thank You!!</blockquote>
				<blockquote>We have gone to many....and this by far is unique, creative, scary and fun. Great for the money...highly recommend it!</blockquote>
				<blockquote>This was a great haunted house...worth the time in line. Reasonably priced for families...much better than the other haunted house venues...a must see!</blockquote>
				<blockquote>I took my 10 and 5 year old kids last year it was the best haunted house ive ever been to. My daughter 10 was screaming and crying the whole time but the 5 year old boy loved it. It was actually pretty scary and realistic thats the best part. Dont miss this</blockquote>
