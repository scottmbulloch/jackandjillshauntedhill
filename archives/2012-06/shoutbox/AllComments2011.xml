        <Text>I went last year with my sister and it was great! Its definately worth the wait and its as if you went to a haunted place that costs $30... If you get scared easily its scary.. there are people everywhere trying to scare you! i thought the wouldnt get me, but they did! I like that every year its in a different place so you dont know what to expect.. cant wait to go this year(:</Text>

        <Text>Better, scarier, and longer than last year! The wait is a lot shorter too. I go to haunted houses every single year and this one left me very shaken. Addressing previous comments, no, you don't do any crawling or anything, it's a straight walkthrough, but it is VERY dark. And I don't believe you go into an actual mine.</Text>

We don't really get scared easily (we watch lots of horror movies) and we are kind of creeped out about going here. Is it really THAT creepy? Like, do people chase you down? Like, can they like touch you (as in to scare you)? </Text>

        <Text>Jack, Jill, im heading up there for the third year tonight hope to see you guys, incostumes of coarse. I dont know why your haunted house isn't number one yet. But I went to 13th floor and it was lame i didnt get scared once. Honest. Ask all my friends. But the first year i went to your place i was screaming the whole way through, btw, i am a professonal audio/video designer, and if you want help designing a commercail for next year, if your having one, im the guy. Good luck guys.</Text>

        <Text>Fellow home haunters here and your first victims of this year. Sorry to hear you are having to deal with some issue(s) forcing to shut you down. We were planning a return trip to see you all on Sunday. For what it's worth, not knowing the reason for the closing, keep the spirit alive. You showed some great original ideas, and have the (spoiler) best meat locker room we've ever seen, commercial or otherwise. We look forward to seeing what you come up with next year. To quote a haunters podcast Hauntcast.. Stay Scary !</Text>

        <Text>I am so sad to hear that you were forced to close early this year. Your attraction has become a part of my family's Halloween tradition. I truly hope you are able to continue next year. Thank you for all that you do to keep the spirit of Halloween alive!</Text>

        <Text>Listen, my gal and I LOVED your haunted house.  We went to every major event in the Valley...spending $25 to $30 each place and the $10 we spend at Jack and Jill's was the best!  Yours was smaller...but quality every step.  Great acting, scenes and overall experience.  We loved it!  We tried to bring other people to it this last weekend to find out you were closed.  We were sad about that.   We will definitely do this again next year.  </Text>
